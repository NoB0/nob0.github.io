I am currently a PhD student in the [IAI group](https://iai.group) at the University of Stavanger, supervised by Prof. [Krisztian Balog](https://krisztianbalog.com). 
My main research interests are user simulation, conversational information access, and information retrieval. I am always open for discussion about these topics, so feel free to contact me.

In the past, I worked as a research and development engineer for MDPI. In this role, I had the chance to participate in research projects, some involving natural language processing, language modelling and social network analysis.
Prior to that, as part of the my studies, I did some internships and had the chance to participate in student exchange programs.
